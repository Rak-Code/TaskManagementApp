## Features

- **Task Management:** Create, update, and delete tasks.
- **User Authentication:** Manage user-specific data.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend Integration:** API endpoints for CRUD operations.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Heroku (Backend)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MySQL database

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASS=your-database-password
   DB_NAME=TASKDB
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

4. **Run the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository/frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```

3. **Build the React App:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Deployment

### Deploying the Backend

1. **Prepare Your Backend for Deployment:**

   Ensure your backend is production-ready and has the necessary environment variables configured.

2. **Deploy to Heroku:**

   - Install the Heroku CLI and log in:

     ```bash
     npm install -g heroku
     heroku login
     ```

   - Create a Heroku app:

     ```bash
     heroku create
     ```

   - Deploy your code:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Deploying backend"
     git push heroku main
     ```

   - Set up environment variables:

     ```bash
     heroku config:set DB_HOST=your-database-host DB_USER=your-database-user DB_PASS=your-database-password DB_NAME=TASKDB JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
     ```

### Deploying the Frontend

1. **Choose a Hosting Platform:**

   Examples include Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

2. **Deploy the Build Directory:**

   Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your chosen hosting service.

## Usage

1. **Frontend:**

   Access the app via the URL provided by your hosting service.

2. **Backend:**

   Ensure your frontend application is configured to use the production backend URL.

## Contributing
